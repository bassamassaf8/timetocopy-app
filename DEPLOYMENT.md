# 🚀 TimeToCopy - Production Deployment Guide

## ✅ **Pre-Deployment Checklist**

Your app is **ready for deployment** with the following considerations:

### **Current Status:**

- ✅ Production build successful
- ✅ TypeScript errors fixed
- ✅ Production optimizations added
- ✅ Security headers configured
- ⚠️ Using in-memory storage (data will reset on restart)

---

## 🌐 **Recommended Deployment Platforms**

### **1. Vercel (Recommended - Zero Config)**

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy from your project directory
vercel

# Follow the prompts:
# - Project name: timetocopy
# - Framework preset: Next.js
# - Deploy: Yes
```

**Pros:**

- Built for Next.js
- Automatic deployments from Git
- Edge functions
- Free hobby tier

### **2. Netlify**

```bash
# Build command: npm run build
# Publish directory: .next
```

### **3. Railway**

```bash
# Connect your GitHub repo
# Railway will auto-detect Next.js
```

### **4. Digital Ocean App Platform**

```bash
# Build command: npm run build
# Run command: npm start
```

---

## ⚙️ **Environment Variables (Optional)**

Create these in your deployment platform:

```env
# Room expiration time (hours)
ROOM_EXPIRATION_HOURS=1

# For production monitoring
NODE_ENV=production
```

---

## 🗄️ **Storage Upgrade (Important for Production)**

**Current limitation:** Your app uses in-memory storage which resets when the server restarts.

### **For Persistent Storage, Choose One:**

#### **Option 1: Upstash Redis (Recommended - Free Tier)**

```bash
npm install @upstash/redis
```

#### **Option 2: Supabase (PostgreSQL)**

```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

#### **Option 3: PlanetScale (MySQL)**

```bash
npm install @planetscale/database
```

**Note:** Your app will work in production with current storage, but data will be lost on restarts.

---

## 🔒 **Security Features (Already Configured)**

✅ Security headers added
✅ Frame protection
✅ Content type protection  
✅ CORS configured

---

## 📊 **Monitoring & Performance**

### **Built-in Logging:**

- Room creation/deletion logged
- Cleanup operations tracked
- Production warnings displayed

### **Performance:**

- Static generation for homepage
- Optimized bundle size (104KB first load)
- Image optimization configured

---

## 🚀 **Quick Deploy Commands**

### **Vercel (Easiest):**

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

### **Build Locally First:**

```bash
npm run build
npm start
# Test at http://localhost:3000
```

---

## 🌍 **Domain Setup**

After deployment, you'll get a URL like:

- **Vercel:** `your-app-name.vercel.app`
- **Netlify:** `your-app-name.netlify.app`

### **Custom Domain:**

1. Purchase domain from registrar
2. Add custom domain in platform settings
3. Update DNS records as instructed

---

## 📱 **Mobile Optimization**

✅ Responsive design implemented
✅ Touch-friendly interface
✅ Mobile-first approach

---

## 🔧 **Post-Deployment Testing**

1. **Create Room:** Test room creation
2. **Join Room:** Test room joining with code
3. **Add Content:** Test text, links, file uploads
4. **Chat:** Test real-time chat
5. **Export:** Test markdown export
6. **Mobile:** Test on mobile devices

---

## ⚡ **Performance Tips**

1. **Static Assets:** Images served through CDN
2. **Caching:** Built-in Next.js optimizations
3. **Bundle Size:** Optimized to ~104KB first load
4. **Server Rendering:** Dynamic routes server-rendered

---

## 🆘 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **"Room not found" errors:**

- Check if server restarted (in-memory storage reset)
- Verify room codes are uppercase

### **File uploads not working:**

- Currently uses placeholder URLs
- For real file uploads, integrate with service like:
  - Cloudinary
  - AWS S3
  - Uploadcare

### **Slow loading:**

- Enable CDN on your platform
- Check internet connection
- Monitor server performance
